# **GT Models - Complementary data for submission on controllable drum generation models**
---

In this website, we provide a number of additional resources to complement the paper submitted to `ISMIR 2024`.

##### **_Anon Performance with the System_**

The following two excerpts are from the live performance using the system. 
As mentioned in the paper, the system was developed in collaboration with ANON, 
for a series of recuring live performances.

> **Note**  
> The organizers of the concert have recorded the entire performance, and will release the videos to the public soon. 
> we will link the full video here. 

The following video is a snippet of the recording made by the organizers.

The following video is a short phone recording. As mentioned above, the full video with good audio quality will be made available.

##### **_System Demo_**

> **Note**
> The demos here are prepared by the authors of the paper.

The following video shows the system in action. The interface shown here is slightly different from the one shared in this website.
However, the underlying system is the same. To download the latest plugin, please visit the [VST Plugins](/resources/source_code_and_vst_plugins/) page.

In this recording, we use an arpegiating bassline played is looped and fed into the system (bottom-right corner). In the meantime, 
a live performance on the synthesizer (top-right) is also fed into the system. The system generates the drums in real-time, which
are then synthesized using a drum synthesizer (left).
